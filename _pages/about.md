## Bio 
I am a Phd Student in statistical signal processing applied to radioastronomy, supervised by 
[Pascal Larzabal](http://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/larzabal-pascal-212499.kjsp), [Mohammed Nabil EL Korso](https://sites.google.com/site/nabkorso/) and [Arnaud Breloy](https://abreloy.github.io/)
within the signal processing group (MOSS) of the SATIE laboratory at Paris-Saclay University. 

Before that, i was a research engineer at [Phasics](https://www.phasics.com/en/) where i helped conceive and develop algorithmic solutions for wavefront sensor analysis.

## Research
My current research interests lie in robust signal processing, statistical learning, structured covariance matrix estimation, radio-interferometry and sensor array processing.
