## Bio 
I am a Phd Student in statistical signal processing applied to radioastronomy, supervised by 
[Pascal Larzabal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=aNwgKEEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Mohammed Nabil EL Korso](https://sites.google.com/site/nabkorso/) and [Arnaud Breloy](https://abreloy.github.io/)
within the signal processing group (MOSS) of the SATIE laboratory at Paris-Saclay University. 

Before that, I was a research engineer at [Phasics](https://www.phasics.com/en/) where i helped conceive and develop algorithmic solutions for wavefront sensor analysis.

## Research

### Research interests
My current research interests lie in robust signal processing, statistical learning, structured covariance matrix estimation, interferometry and sensor array processing.

### My Phd
During my Phd I proposed multiple statistical signal processing algorithms for radio-iterferometers or telescope arrays. 

Notably I proposed a statistical modelization of radiofrequency inteferences derived from the physical 
model of wave propagation from which I designed a multifrequency array calibration algorithm.

In a second line of work, I proposed a radio-interferometric imaging algorithm robust to the presence
of outliers in the data based on the expectation-maximization algorithm.

Finally, I am currently working on a neural architecture based on the methodology of algorithm unrolling 
that produces an interpretable learning imaging algorithm robust to the presence of radiofrequency interferences.
